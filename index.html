                    My journey into the world of music started at home with my dad. He’s the one who introduced me to the guitar and inspired me to dive into rock music. I’ll never forget the first time he handed me his guitar and let me join in while he played with his friends. It wasn’t just about learning chords or playing songs—it was about feeling the music and connecting with others through it. That’s when I knew music would be a big part of my life.
                        
                        One thing I’ve always loved about playing the guitar is improvising solos. For me, it’s not just about sticking to a script but creating something raw and real in the moment. Every time I perform, I try to bring something new to the stage, something that’s uniquely mine. I’ve been lucky to play at big events over the years, and the energy from the crowd always pushes me to give it my all. There’s nothing quite like the rush of performing live and seeing people react to my music.
                        
                        Looking ahead, I have big goals. I’m going to become a famous artist—someone who inspires others the way my dad inspired me. Music is my passion, my voice, and my way of connecting with the world. With every chord I play and every solo I improvise, I’m building towards that dream, and I can’t wait to see where it takes me.

My dad’s music was the soundtrack of my early years. Whether it was the soft strumming of his guitar late at night or the lively jam sessions he hosted with his friends, there was always music in our home. He’d let me sit in on those sessions, teaching me to appreciate the magic of a well-played chord and the beauty of improvisation. Sometimes, he’d even hand me an instrument and encourage me to play along, no matter how clumsy my attempts were. Those moments weren’t just fun—they taught me to be creative, to take risks, and to enjoy the process of learning.

While my dad was busy with his music, my mom was the one who kept everything running smoothly. She managed the family business with skill and precision, showing me what it meant to work hard and stay focused. She often said that my dad brought the soul to our family, while she brought the structure. Together, they made a perfect team, and I learned the importance of balancing passion with practicality.

                        In My Teenage Years
                        
                        In my teenage years, music became the heartbeat of my world. Growing up, I was always surrounded by it—my dad was a guitarist, and his love for music was contagious. He’d play his guitar late into the night, the sound of the strings weaving through the house like a second language. I’d sit in the doorway of his room, listening to everything from classic rock anthems to the soulful blues that ran deep in his veins. I never really thought about it back then, but without even trying, he was laying the foundation for something much bigger.
                        
                        It wasn’t until I was about twelve that I actually asked him to teach me a chord. I remember how hesitant I was, unsure if I could live up to the sound I heard him create. But my dad, patient as always, smiled and showed me the basics: a few simple chords, the feel of the strings under my fingers. From there, something clicked. I started practicing daily, and slowly, the guitar became more than just an instrument—it became my escape, my voice.
                        
                        By the time high school rolled around, I was fully immersed in the world of music. I started playing at school events—small talent shows, fundraisers, and even random jam sessions in the halls. But the real thrill came when I signed up for Battle of the Bands. I remember standing backstage for my first competition, adrenaline buzzing in my veins. The other bands were all so talented, each of them tuning their instruments and prepping for their turn. My heart was racing, but there was also something electrifying about it. It wasn’t just about winning; it was about feeling that connection to the crowd, the stage, the music.</p>

                    <p>As I entered adulthood, I continued to play, though the performances were no longer limited to school events or battles. Music became a steady presence in my life. I wasn’t just the kid in the back of the room anymore; I was someone who had come into my own as a musician, playing for people who appreciated what I had to offer. But even as I honed my craft, I carried with me the same lessons my dad taught me: play with passion, never forget why you started, and let the music speak louder than any nerves or doubts.

                        Looking back now, I realize that my dad’s influence was more than just teaching me how to play the guitar. He gave me the confidence to perform, the belief that my voice—my music—mattered. And in adulthood, every time I pick up my guitar, I know that his spirit is there, strumming along with me.</p>

                    <p>My hobby is playing guitar, and it’s been an incredible journey of growth and passion. I’ve been putting in a lot of practice lately, and I’m thrilled to announce that I have a gig coming up soon where I’ll be performing some of my favorite songs, as well as a few original pieces I’ve written. Performing live is such an exciting challenge—it pushes me to step out of my comfort zone, connect with the crowd, and share the music I love. In addition to the gig, there are a few other events lined up that I’m looking forward to, including open mics and jam sessions with fellow musicians.</p>

                    <p>My outdoor hobbies are an essential part of my life, and they bring me so much joy and fulfillment. One of my main passions is playing basketball on the court. Whether it’s a friendly pickup game or a more competitive match, I love the energy and intensity of the game. The feeling of running up and down the court, making plays, and working with teammates is something that keeps me coming back for more. In addition to basketball, I also enjoy practicing guitar outdoors when the weather is nice. Playing outside, surrounded by nature, gives me a sense of peace and inspiration. Both of these hobbies help me stay active, challenge myself, and connect with others in meaningful ways.</p>

                    <p>My favorite food is takoyaki because I love the combination of flavors and textures. The crispy outside and soft, savory inside with the octopus just tastes amazing. The sauces and bonito flakes on top add extra flavor that makes each bite even better. It’s a fun food to eat too, and I enjoy how it’s often served fresh and hot, which makes it even more satisfying.</p>

                    <p>They are my close friends—the ones who stand by me in all my moments, from the wildest adventures to the nerve-wracking hours in the guidance office. They’re the ones who laugh with me even when we’re caught, who whisper jokes to lighten the mood while we wait for the lecture we know is coming.

                        They’re not just there for the fun; they’re there for the aftermath too, helping me own up to my mistakes and figure out how to move forward. They make even the craziest situations feel less heavy, turning trouble into stories we’ll laugh about for years. With them, life is unpredictable, messy, and absolutely worth every second. I miss you all so much, (BROTHER HOOD)

Outside the classroom, they’re not just a mentor but also a collaborator and a friend who shares the same passion for music.

                                Our friendship goes beyond the usual boundaries; it’s built on mutual respect, creativity, and a shared love for what we do. Whether we’re rehearsing, performing, or just hanging out, they remind me that music is about connection—about finding people who inspire you, guide you, and make the journey worthwhile.</p>
